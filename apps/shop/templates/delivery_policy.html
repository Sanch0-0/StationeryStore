        <h4><strong class="bold-text-info">How much is delivery?</strong></h4>
        <p>
          We offer FREE delivery on all orders over £25. Otherwise, we charge a
          low flat rate shipping fee of £4.95 per delivery.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          At the moment we are not able to offer expedited delivery options.
        </p>
        <h4><strong class="bold-text-info">When can I expect my order to be dispatched?</strong></h4>
        <p>
          We always aim to dispatch orders within 24-hours between Monday to
          Thursday. Orders placed Friday evening will dispatch on Monday
          morning. In some cases or due to unforseen circumstances, dispatch can
          take longer. We will always aim to dispatch within 4 business days.
          Afterwards, it will take around 2-3 business days for the carrier to
          deliver your purchase.
        </p>
        <p>
          If one of the items you ordered is not in stock, your order may be
          delayed. If this is case, we will get in touch with you to notify you
          of potential delays as soon as possible. In the unlikely event that we
          are not able to complete your order for any reason, we will notify you
          as soon as possible to issue a refund or give you an alternative
          option.&nbsp;If you have not received an email for us, please check

        <h4><strong class="bold-text-info">When will my order arrive?</strong></h4>
        <p>
          Delivery takes around 3 business days from dispatch. In rare cases,
          orders might be delayed by factors beyond our control. Although we aim
          to give you the best shipping times possible to us, we cannot always
          guarantee arrivals of orders within 3 business days of dispatch.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the day of delivery, you will receive an SMS or email with the name
          of your delivery driver and a 2 hour time slot in which your parcel
          will be delivered to your house.
